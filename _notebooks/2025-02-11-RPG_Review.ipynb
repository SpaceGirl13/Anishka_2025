    "The first class is GameControl. Within that, there are two attributes: gameLevels[], which contains options for which level of the game to play, and currentLevelIndex, which tracks the currently active level. There are three methods within that, start(), transitionToLevel(), which can help you switch levels, and gameLoop(), which makes the game’s main loop run.\n",

    "GameObject references GameLevel and holds multiple instances of it. The method state{} manages the character’s current state in the game (what it’s doing). Hitbox{} tells how large the area is that other characters can interact with. The other methods draw the objects in the game, check for collisions, resize the object, update, and destroy the objects.\n",
